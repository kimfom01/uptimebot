# Uptime Bot

The Uptime Bot is designed to monitor server availability by periodically sending GET requests to a specified URL. This ensures that the server remains active and helps in identifying any downtime or service interruptions. The bot operates at user-defined intervals, allowing for customizable monitoring based on the specific needs of the server.
